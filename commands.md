# Commands
This page lists all the BlockyJump commands along with information on how to use them.  
The plugin itself contains in-built command help and a tab completer, which will both help you with these commands.
It is still a lot easier to use the [➜GUI](gui.md), so you don't necessarily need all these commands.

# Permissions
This page lists all the BlockyJump permissions along with information on what they are for.  
If you are looking for a specific permission for a command, also check the [âžœcommands](commands.md).  
By default, every player has the blockyjump.player permissions and only operators have the blockyjump.admin permissions. It's not recommended to use blockyjump.*.

# Arenas
BlockyJump arenas are basically box-shaped areas containing your parkour course. Your entire parkour has to be inside the arena bounds.  
A player leaving the arena bounds is seen as a fail and will be teleported back to the last checkpoint.  
To create and edit arenas, you need the `blockyjump.admin.arena` permission. ([âžœPermissions](permissions.md))

?> Be sure to finish building your parkour before you start to set it up in the plugin.

## Creating arenas
After putting together the blocks of your parkour, you are ready to actually create the BlockyJump arena.
Each arena has a name, which is the unique identifier.  
You can create an arena in the Admin Arena GUI or by using the following command:

`/bgj admin arena add <name>`

After creating the arena, you automatically enter Arena Edit Mode.
